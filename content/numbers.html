<body>

  <p>As of 2016 the list price of an A380 is US$432.6 million. Negotiated discounts made the actual prices much lower, and industry experts questioned whether the A380 project would ever pay for itself.The first aircraft was sold-and-leased-back by Singapore Airlines in 2007 to Dr. Peters for $197 million.

  <strong>An A380's <em>hourly cost is about $26,000</em>, or around $50 per seat hour</strong>, which compares to $44 per seat hour for a Boeing 777-300ER, and $90 per seat hour for a Boeing 747-400 as of November 2015.</p>
